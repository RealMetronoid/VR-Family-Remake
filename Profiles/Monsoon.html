        <h1>Rowan (Monsoon)</h1>
        <h2>-Gemini incarnate-</h2>
        <p>You could claim to be prepared for everything and will still end up surprised when it comes to Rowan.<br>
            Being the literal definition of a Gemini, she can be the most energetic person you have ever seen, but once her social batteries run out,<br>
            she will enter the “Rowan-coma”, which can easily be identified by her being completely silent all of a sudden and<br>everyone around her telling her to go to sleep.<br>
            Naturally witty and entertaining, Rowan can fill a room with energy and good vibes by just being there.</p>
