        <h2>-certified Cutie-</h2>
        <p>The general rule of thumb is: “If it exists as a world in VRchat, Voxie most likely fell asleep there already”.<br>
            Being a natural explorer at heart, even the best kept secrets in VRchat will eventually be found by Voxie,<br>
            leading him to show his friends new discoveries every day.<br>
            Voxies calm and relaxed manners are a blessing to be around while also shaking things up every now and then with a good pun or joke.</p>
