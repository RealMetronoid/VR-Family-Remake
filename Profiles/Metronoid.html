        <h1>Metronoid</h1>
        <h2>-VRchat addict-</h2>
        <p>Metronoid is the heart and soul of the Family, doing a far better job moderating the Discord Server than Cheeto does.<br>
            Known for his vast collection of Avatar assets and creating aesthetically pleasing worlds and avatars,<br>
            Metro naturally attracts a lot of joiners to every world he goes to, even when he is just hanging out in VRchat whilst working on his creations,<br>
            mostly due to the fact that his presence is naturally pleasant and he is as good of a listener as he is entertaining.</p>
